# The Portfolio of Chandu

* ## I can help
  If you have a project that you want to get started, think you need my help with something or just fancy saying hey, then get in touch.

* ## Hello! I am Emme Clark.
  I am a SF-based product designer with a masters in human-computer interaction and 5+ years experience in design and user research. I do the full range of design, from strategy and systems down to pixel-perfect designs.

  I do my best work with inventive visual designers, snarky but good-hearted developers, trusting product managers, and flexible schedules. In turn, I will give meticulous, user-loved design work. 

  I am looking for a senior or lead product design role and will be particularly interested in a role if it's one of these things: 

  * is in the biotech or health space,
  * involves working on complex tools,
  * involves data visualization, or
  * is in a novel space (voice interactions, immersive experiences, AR, etc.). 

  But enough about me. Tell me about you. 

* ## Insouciance: a relaxed and calm state.

  I pride myself in my ability to stay calm, to stay in the moment. This applies to design, to running, to living. My name is Cole Townsend, and I am a designer.

  I also study Art History at Williams College. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping in that order. I think programming is cool, but don’t actually program that much. I’m always trying to learn new things, though. XCode and iOS development are on my shortlist.

  I am taking on new work! Let’s get in touch.
