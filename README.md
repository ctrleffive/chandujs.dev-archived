# The Portfolio of Chandu

* ## Hello! I am Emme Clark.
  I am a SF-based product designer with a masters in human-computer interaction and 5+ years experience in design and user research. I do the full range of design, from strategy and systems down to pixel-perfect designs.

  I do my best work with inventive visual designers, snarky but good-hearted developers, trusting product managers, and flexible schedules. In turn, I will give meticulous, user-loved design work. 

  But enough about me. Tell me about you.
